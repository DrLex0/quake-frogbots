# Quake Frogbot Clan Arena v2

Based on:
- FBCA, Frogbot Clan Arena - mod that combines Frogbot, Clan Arena and Kombat Teams (KTPro)
- Trinca and Spike's last known sources
- Decompiled source file from the old waypoint tool (how dare I decompile a 25-year old abandoned program, so sue me)


## What in Shub-Nigguraths name is a Frogbot?

The Quake Frogbot allows to add computer-controlled players to the first _Quake_ game. (Not to be confused with some JFrog thing.). It was created by _Robert 'Frog' Field_ in 1997. The Frogbot is regarded as one of the better performing bots. With a properly crafted waypoint file, the bots simulate a real human opponent rather well, and are still impressive despite their age and the fact that it is all implemented in QuakeC.

The bot relies on _waypoint files_ that have to be created for each map and that need to be compiled into the Frogbot. In the first decade of the 21st century, _Trinca_ did a gargantuan job of making and collecting waypoints for about 400 maps.

The old Frogbot had a few issues that lead to practically nobody creating new waypoints after Trinca's anymore:
- Building the qwprogs with support for more than a few 100 maps was only possible with a very specific Windows build of the FTEQCC compiler.
- The waypoint creation tool had quite a few usability problems, making the workflow awkward.
- The source for the waypoint tool had become unavailable (or near impossible to find), making it infeasible to resume editing existing waypoints. Either one had to do a whole map in one go (insane for larger maps), or manually edit the code.


## Why this project?

The goal: revive the Frogbots in a way that:
- makes it easier to build the qwprogs.dat (with any recent version of fteqcc or maybe other compilers);
- makes it possible to resume editing existing waypoint data;
- makes it easier to create and edit waypoints;
- fixes some issues.

**Done so far:**
1. Solved the `numpr_globals` problem without requiring the `-Ovectorcalls` option in fteqcc, which has been broken for ages when trying to compile for many maps. This allows to build with any recent fteqcc, and basically now allows an _infinite_ number of maps to be built into the qwprogs, until we hit some other QuakeC limit.
2. Simpler management of map waypoint files, with a Python script that can also convert existing files for the above fix.
3. Restored ability to build the **waypoint tool** as shown in [Mick's guide](https://mickkn.mooo.com/quakeworld/frogbot/).  
   It is now possible to _resume editing_ from existing waypoints, if you compile them into the tool and then simply load the map. This makes creating waypoints _way more feasible_ through an edit-test cycle.  
   The waypoint tool also allows to examine existing maps to better understand how to create good waypoints for new maps.  
   Also added usability improvements to the tool, like:
   - made _closest marker mode_ way more useful, by fixing reliability issues and also allowing to cycle between 3 nearest markers; this allows to reliably select hard-to-reach markers like teleport triggers;
   - print more info next to goal and zone, like coordinates and marker type;
   - print paths going out and coming into active marker (including special modes).
4. Made _shootable doors_ work across more maps than only _dm6_ (I kept the `dm6_door` name for the sake of legacy and because it's a good example). Works with both horizontal and vertical doors.

Planned:
- Add Trinca's waypointsâ€¦ and perhaps some new ones.
- Something resembling documentation.
- Improve upon Mick's waypoint guide. Figure out the more advanced things.
- Tool to generate waypoint qc file from annotations in a `.map` file (currently only a concept, but should be easy).

No promises about dates or reaching these goals whatsoever. It is done when it's done.

Not really planned, but who knows:
- Make Frogbot work in non-Quakeworld engines (it builds and runs, but is not usable).

Wild ideas:
- Find a way to avoid having to compile waypoints into the (qw)progs.dat, but I'm not sure if possible at all.
- Construct reasonable waypoints automatically with AI and evolutionary algorithms and blockchain and all other buzzwords we can throw against it.
